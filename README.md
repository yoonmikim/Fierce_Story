# Fierce Stories

 In order to make an open, inclusive, accessible community for children, this app lets children and their parents to create their own stories (just like Mad Libs) while learning about consent, responsibility, equality, and belonging. They can also print, share to social media, make it dark mode (Accessibility feature built with cookies and sessions along with custom pure CSS).
 
+ Constructed a Ruby on Rails backend to store information used by the client
+ Rails Auth (Login / Signup) with validations (secure_password, presence and length for name, uniqueness for username, and valid email format) using Bcrypt gem.
+ Developed MVC framework using Ruby on Rails : ActiveRecord / SQL - PostgreSQL / Capybara / Rake (Migrations, schema, seed) / Multiple has_many_through, belongs_to, has_many relationships (30+ models with attributes and foreign keys) / full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) - user can read existing stories (of their own or pre-existing templates), create new stories and store on their storybooks, edit their inputs on stories and update, and delete stories if they no longer wish to keep.
+ Improved on debugging skills and patience through Debugging tools (binding.pry and byebug), teamwork and communication skills through pair programming.
